A clean, dark Tmux theme that gives a tribute to district [Karak.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158416209@N08/32490822757)

### Installation using TPM

In your `tmux.conf`:

### Karak Night Theme

Colors are mostly hardcoded for now. May improve it at late stages.

Improvements:
- Better scripts handling.
- Cmus status has a progress bar
- Git scripts has diff status
- Windows has custom seven-segmented display number style
- Better terminal icons
